# Arduijo Nano Canon Remote Camera Shutter - Including LED Matric (Work in progress)

This repo is work in progress, but should work.

## Introduction

In this repo there's a sample on how to control a Canon 650D or similar camera. I've also used a 8x32 Dot Matrix board, to show a count-down. A button is added to trigger the shutter.

My original id√©a was to add a touch or measure distance-sensor, but due to lack of time to do the final wood-frame work for the whole setup, I ended up finding a software for my laptop, instead. But.. Here's the project "as is", which worked just fine. But it's not optimized, refactored or anything like that.

I've used Platform.io to compile and flash the code to my Arduino Nano.

## Parts

I've used a [Arduino Nano](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdQsR7L), a cheap [8x32 Dot Matrix](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DdT4ZK1) from AliExpress and a [Optocoupler](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DmFqOQd).

_Please don't judge me ;)... This is very much work-in-progress...._
